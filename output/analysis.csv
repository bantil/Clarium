## Summary of the Document
The purpose of this Executive Order is to protect opportunities for women and girls to compete in sports safely and fairly. It aims to oppose male participation in women's sports and to rescind funding from educational programs that deny women and girls fair athletic opportunities.

The main directives of this order include:
- Affirmative protection of all-female athletic opportunities and all-female locker rooms to ensure equal opportunity as guaranteed by Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972.
- Prioritization of Title IX enforcement actions against institutions that deny female students equal opportunity in sports by requiring them to compete with or against males in women’s sports.
- Review of grants to educational programs and the rescinding of funding to programs that fail to comply with this policy.
- Provision of necessary resources by the Department of Justice to ensure expeditious enforcement of this policy.
- Convening of representatives of major athletic organizations and female athletes to promote fair and safe policies.
- Rescinding of support for sports programs where female sports are based on identity, not sex.
- Promotion of international rules to protect a sex-based female sports category.
- Review of policies permitting admission to the U.S. of males seeking to participate in women's sports, with the objective of preventing such entry.

The Secretary of Education, the Attorney General, all executive departments and agencies, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, the Secretary of State, the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs’ Sports Diplomacy Division, the Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations, and the Secretary of Homeland Security are required to carry out the actions outlined in this order.
